*	What is real-time web?
	*	Real-time Web.
			The real-time web is a set of technologies and practices that enable users to receive information as soon as it is published by its authors, rather than requiring that they or their software check a source periodically for updates.
	*	Examples:
		*	Look.io
		*	Google analytics
		*	Monitter
			*	Shmapr
		*	Transloadit (Real-time video encoding)
		*	Chat demo: http://chat.mathachew.com/

*	About Node
	*	Designed for building fast and scalable network applications
	*	Similar to Twisted or EventMachine EXCEPT, designed around non-blocking libraries
	*	Explain Blocking and Async
	*	Non-blocking.
		In node, non-blocking means that any activity taking a long time to finish, such as file system access, database queries, network communication, are requested and put aside until the results are ready to be returned in a callback function.

*	NPM
	*	.NET has Nuget, Ruby has gems, Node gets NPM
	*	Local install and global install

*	Javascript!?
	*	It's FAST! (V8)
	*	Flattens the stack
		*	You've got to use it anyway
	*	First class functions!
		*	Makes event driven programming very easy.
			$(document).read(function() {
				console.log('do something awesome!');
			});

*	Socket.IO
	Making real-time communication easy.
	*	Supported Communication Transports
		*	WebSocket
		*	Adobe Flash Socket
		*	Ajax Long Polling
		*	Ajax multi-part streaming
		*	Forever iframe
		*	JSONP Polling

	*	Supported Browsers
		*	Desktop
			*	IE 5.5+
			*	Safari 3+
			*	Chrome 4+
			*	FF 3+
			*	Opera 10.61+
		*	Mobile
			*	iPhone Safari
			*	iPad Safari
			*	Android WebKit

*	When to use node?
	*	Web APIs
		*	Hope you like JSON as much as I do.
	*	Streaming Data
		*	Real-time encoding transloadit
	*	Soft real-time applications
		*	Versus Hard or Firm real-time
	*	Server push applications
	*	Single page apps
	*	Spawning other programs to do work

*	When not to use node?
	*	Hard real-time systems
	*	Simple CRUD apps
	*	CPU Heavy applications
